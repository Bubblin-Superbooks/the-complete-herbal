<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Or a Cordial Syrup.</p><p><em>College.</em> Take of Rhenish Wine two pounds, Rose Water two ounces and a half, Cloves two scruples, Cinnamon half a dram, Ginger two scruples, Sugar three ounces and a half, boil it to the consistence of a Julep, adding Ambergris three grains, Musk one grain.</p><p><em>Culpeper.</em> If you would have this Julep keep long, you may put in more sugar, and yet if close stopped, it will not easily corrupt because it is made up only of Wine,  indeed the wisest way is to order the quantity of sugar according to the palate of him that takes it. It restores such as are in consumptions, comforts the heart, cherishes the drooping spirits, and is of an opening quality, thereby carrying away those vapours which might otherwise annoy the brain and heart: You may take an ounce at a time, or two if you please.</p><h5><Em>syrupus Infusionis Florum Cariophillorum.</em></h5><p>Or Syrup of Clove-gilliflowers.</p></div> </div>
