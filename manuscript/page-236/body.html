The stalks are slender, leaning downwards and bear many small yellow flowers thereon, with some yellow threads in the middle, standing about a smooth green head, which, when it is ripe, is a little rough, and contains small brownish seeds. The root is of a blackish brown colour, as big as oneâ€™s little finger, but growing long, with some threads thereat; and by the small string it quickly spreads over the ground.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It grows by wood sides, hedge sides, the path-way in fields, and in the borders and corners of them almost through all this land.</p></div> </div>
