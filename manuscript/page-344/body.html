The root is somewhat woody and white, especially the main downright one, with many fibres, abiding many years, shooting forth roots every way round about, and new branches every year.</p><p><em>Place.</em> This grows throughout this land, both by the way sides and in meadows, as also by hedge-sides, and upon the sides of banks, and borders of fields.</p><p><em>Time.</em> It flowers in Summer, and the seed is ripe usually before the end of August.</p></div> </div>
