<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Ostrutij.</em> Masterwort, given once before under the name of <em>Imperitoria</em>. But I have something else to do than to write one thing twice as they did.</p><p><em>Pastinatæ, Sativæ, and silvestris.</em> Garden and Wild Parsnips. They are of a temperate quality, inclining something to heat: The Garden Parsnips provoke lust, and nourish as much and more too, than any root ordinarily eaten: the wild are more physical, being cutting, cleansing, and opening: they resist the bitings of venomous beasts, ease pains and stitches in the sides, and are a sovereign remedy against the wind cholic.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Pentafylli.</em> Of Cinqfyl, commonly called Five-leaved, or Five-finger’d grass: the root is very drying, but moderately hot: It is admirable against all fluxes, and stops blood flowing from any part of the body: it helps infirmities of the liver and lungs, helps putrified ulcers of the mouth, the root boiled in vinegar is good against the shingles, and appeases the rage of any fretting sores.</p></div> </div>
