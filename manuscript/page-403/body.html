<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">flowers, scarce appearing above the husk, and usually torn on one side, ending in five round points, growing one above another, of a deadish yellowish colour, somewhat paler towards the edges, with many purplish veins therein, and of a dark, yellowish purple in the bottom of the flower, with a small point of the same colour in the middle, each of them standing in a hard close husk, which after the flowers are past, grow very like the husk of Asarabacca, and somewhat sharp at the top points, wherein is contained much small seed, very like Poppy seed, but of a dusky, greyish colour. The root is great, white, and thick, branching forth divers ways under ground, so like a Parsnip root (but that it is not so white that it has deceived others. The whole plant more than the root, has a very heavy, ill, soporiferous smell, somewhat offensive. )</p><p><em>Place.</em> It commonly grows by the way-sides, and under hedge-sides and walls.</p></div> </div>
