If the weather be frosty, it flowers not until January, or that the hard weather be over.</p><p><em>Government and virtues.</em> It is a tree of Mars. The seeds in the berries beaten to powder being drank in wine, are held singularly good against the stone, and are good for the dropsy. The distilled water of the flowers stay the lask. The seed cleared from the down, bruised and boiled in wine, and drank, is good for inward tormenting pains. If cloths or sponges be wet in the distilled water, and applied to any place wherein thorns and splinters, or the like, do abide in the flesh, it will notably draw them forth.</p><p>And thus you see the thorn gives a medicine for its own pricking, and so doth almost every thing else.</p><h5>Hemlock.</h5></div> </div>
