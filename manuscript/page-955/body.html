It is hot in the third degree, strengthens the stomach and heart exceedingly, and helps concoction.</p><p><em>Maceris, &c.</em> It is held to be the inner bark of Nutmeg-tree, helps fluxes and spitting of blood.</p><p><em>Petroselini Rad.</em> Of Parsley root: opens obstructions, provokes urine and the menses, warms a cold stomach, expels wind, and breaks the stone. Use them as grass roots, and take out the inner pith as you were taught in smallage roots.</p><p><em>Prunelli Silvestris.</em> Of Sloe-tree. I know no use of it.</p><p><em>Pinearum putaminae.</em> Pine shucks, or husks. I suppose they mean of the cones that hold the seeds; both those and also the bark of the tree, stop fluxes, and help the lungs.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Querci.</em> Of Oak-tree. Both the bark of the oak, and Acorn Cups are drying and cold, binding, stop fluxes</p></div> </div>
