The root is long and slender, of a pale brownish colour on the outside, and of a horseflesh colour on the inside, with many hard fibres thereat, and very harsh in taste.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It usually grows in watery ditches, ponds, lakes, and moor sides, which are always overflowed with water.</p></div> </div>
