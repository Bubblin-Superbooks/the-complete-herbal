<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Nymphea.</em> See the flowers.</p><p><em>Ocynum.</em> Basil, hot and moist. The best use that I know of it, is, it gives speedy deliverance to women in travail. Let them not take above half a dram of it at a time in powder, and be sure also the birth be ripe, else it causes abortion.</p><p><em>Oleæ folia.</em> Olive leaves: they are hard to come by here.</p><p><em>Ononis.</em> Restharrow. See the roots.</p><p><em>Ophioglossum.</em> Adder’s-tongue. The leaves are very drying: being boiled in oil they make a dainty green balsam for green wounds: taken inwardly, they help inward wounds.</p><p><em>Origanum.</em> Origany: a kind of wild Marjoram; hot and dry in the third degree, helps the bitings of venomous beasts, such as have taken Opium, Hemlock, or Poppy; provokes urine, brings down the menses, helps old coughs; in an ointment it helps scabs and itch.</p></div> </div>
