The root is small with strings.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It is commonly found under hedges, and on the sides of ditches, under houses, or in shadowed lanes, and other waste grounds, in almost every part of this land.</p><p><em>Time.</em> They flower somewhat early, and abide a great while; the leaves continue green until Winter, and sometimes abide, except the Winter be very sharp and cold.</p></div> </div>
