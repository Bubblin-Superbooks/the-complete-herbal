Among which arises up usually but one strong, round, hairy, brown stalk, two or three feet high, with smaller leaves set here and there upon it. At the top thereof grow many small yellow flowers, one above another, in long spikes; after which come rough heads of seed, hanging downwards, which will cleave to and stick upon garments, or any thing that shall rub against them. The knot is black, long, and somewhat woody, abiding many years, and shooting afresh every Spring; which root, though small, hath a reasonable good scent. )</p><p><em>Place.</em> It grows upon banks, near the sides of hedges.</p><p><em>Time.</em> It flowers in July and August, the seed being ripe shortly after.</p></div> </div>
