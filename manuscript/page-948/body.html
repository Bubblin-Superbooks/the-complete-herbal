They help diseases and ulcers in the throat.</p><p><em>Trinitatis herb√¶.</em> Hearts-ease, or Pansies. I know no great virtue they have.</p><p><em>Tunicis.</em> I shall tell you the virtue when I know what it is.</p><p><em>Tripolij.</em> The root purges flegm, expels poison.</p><p><em>Turbith.</em> The root purges flegm, (being hot in the third degree chiefly from the exterior parts of the body: it is corrected with ginger, or Mastich. Let not the vulgar be too busy with it. )</p><p><em>Tuburnum.</em> Or Toad-stools. Whether these be roots or no, it matters not much : for my part I know but little need of them, either in food or physic.</p><p><em>Victorialis.</em> A foreign kind of Garlick. They say, being hung about the neck of cattle that are blind suddenly, it helps them; and defends those that bear it, from evil spirits.</p></div> </div>
