The root is round and most usually smooth, greyish without, and white within, having small fibres at the head of the root, and bottom of the stalk.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It grows very plentifully in many places of this land, but especially in all the west parts thereof, upon stone and mud walls, upon rocks also, and in stony places upon the ground, at the bottom of old trees, and sometimes on the bodies of them that are decayed and rotten.</p><p><em>Time.</em> It usually flowers in the beginning of May, and the seed ripening quickly after, sheds itself; so that about the end of May, usually the stalks and leaves are withered, dry, and gone until September, then the leaves spring up again, and so abide all winter.</p></div> </div>
