The stalks bear large tufts of white flowers, with a deep purple spot in the middle, which are contracted together when the seed begins to ripen, that the middle part being hollow and low, and the outward stalk rising high, makes the whole umbel to show like a birdâ€™s nest. The root small, long, and hard, and unfit for meat, being somewhat sharp and strong.</p><p><em>Place.</em> The wild kind grows in divers parts of this land plentifully by the field-sides, and untilled places.</p></div> </div>
