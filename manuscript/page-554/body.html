The roots are divers thick, round, white tuberous clogs; and the plant grows not so big in some places as in others where it is found.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It is frequent in almost every county of this land, and is cherished in gardens with us, where it grows greater than that which is wild, and grows in shadowy sides of fields and woods.</p><p><em>Time.</em> It flowers about July, and the seed is ripe in August.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Government and virtues.</em> The Moon owns the herb, and he that knows but her exaltaration, knows what I say is true. Orpine is seldom used in inward medicines </p></div> </div>
