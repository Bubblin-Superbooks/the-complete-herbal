<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter VI.</h4><p class="  start-chapter"><em>Of repelling Medicines.</em></p><p>Repelling medicines are of contrary operation to these three last mentioned, viz. attenuating, drawing, and discussive medicines: It is true, there is but little difference between these three, some hold none at all; and if you will be so nice, you may oppose them thus. And so medicines making thick, correspond to attenuating medicines, or such as make thin, repelling medicines are opposed to such as draw, and such as retain the humours and make them tough, are opposite to such as discuss, some hold this niceness needless.</p></ul></div> </div>
