It is most probable that they mean dragons, the roots of which cleanse mightily, and take away proud, or dead flesh, the very smell of them is hurtful for pregnant women: outwardly in ointments, they take away scurf, morphew, and sun-burning; I would not wish any, unless very well read in physic, to take them inwardly. <em>Matthiolus</em>, <em>Dioscorides</em>.</p></div> </div>
