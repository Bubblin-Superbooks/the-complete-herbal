<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">leaves a-piece, standing on a stalk together, one above another, with yellow pointels in the middle, composed of four or five yellow threads set together, which afterwards run into so many pendulous green berries, of the bigness of small pease, full of green juice, and small whitish round flat seed lying within it. The root is white, and a little woody when it hath given flower and fruit, with many small fibres at it; The whole plant is of a waterish insipid taste, but the juice within the berries is somewhat viscous, and of a cooling and binding quality.</p><p><em>Place.</em> It grows wild with us under our walls, and in rubbish, the common paths, and sides of hedges and fields, as also in our gardens here in England, without any planting.</p><p><em>Time.</em> It lies down every year, and rises up again of its own sowing, but springs not until the latter end of April at the soonest.</p></div> </div>
