<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Swallow-wort, and teazles were handled before.</p><p><em>Ulmariæ, Reginæ, prati, &c.</em> Mead-sweet. Cold and dry, binding, stops fluxes, and the immoderate flowing of the menses: you may take a dram at a time.</p><p><em>Urticæ.</em> Of Nettles. See the leaves.</p><p><em>Zedoariæ.</em> Of Zedoary, or Setwall. This and <em>Zurumbet</em>, according to <em>Rhasis</em>, and <em>Mesue</em>, are all one; <em>Avicenna</em> thinks them different: I hold with <em>Mesue</em>; indeed they differ in form, for the one is long, the other round; they are both hot and dry in the second degree, expel wind, resist poison, stop fluxes, and the menses, stay vomiting, help the cholic, and kill worms; you may take half a dram at a time.</p><p><em>Zingiberis.</em> Of Ginger. Helps digestion, warms the stomach, clears the sight, and is profitable for old men: heats the joints, and therefore is profitable against the gout, expels wind; it is hot and dry in the second degree.</p><p>BARKS.</p></div> </div>
