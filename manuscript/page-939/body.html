They are temperately hot, the greater provokes urine and the menses, helps the stranguary, stays rheums in the head, and takes away the pricking pains thereof. The lesser resist poison, assuages the swelling of the testicles, coming either through wind or cold, helps cold taken after sweating or labour, wind cholic: outwardly it draws out thorns, and cures both wounds and ulcers.</em></p><p>Pimpinellæ, &c. <em>Of Burnet. It doth this good, to bring forth a gallant physical herb.</em></p><p>Plantaginis. <em>Of Plantane. The root is something dryer than the leaf, but not so cold, it opens stoppages of the liver, helps the jaundice, and ulcers of the reins and bladder. A little bit of the root being eaten, instantly stays pains in the head, even to admiration.</em></p></div> </div>
