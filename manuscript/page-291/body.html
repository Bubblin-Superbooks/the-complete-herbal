<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Darnel meal applied in a poultice draws forth splinters and broken bones in the flesh: The red Darnel, boiled in red wine and taken, stays the lask and all other fluxes, and womenâ€™s bloody issues; and restrains urine that passes away too suddenly.</p><h5>Dill.</h5><p><em>Descript.</em> The common Dill grows up with seldom more than one stalk, neither so high, nor so great usually as Fennel, being round and fewer joints thereon, whose leaves are sadder, and somewhat long, and so like Fennel that it deceives many, but harder in handling, and somewhat thicker, and of a strong unpleasant scent: The tops of the stalks have four branches and smaller umbels of yellow flowers, which turn into small seed, somewhat flatter and thinner than Fennel seed. The root is somewhat small and woody, perishes every year after it hath borne seed: and is also unprofitable, being never put to any use.</p></div> </div>
