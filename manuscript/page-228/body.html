The stalks rise up a yard high, or better, being creased or hollow, having leaves at the joints, but lesser; and at the tops of the branched stalks, umbels or tufts of white flowers; after which comes long crested black shining seed, pointed at both ends, tasting quick, yet sweet and pleasant. The root is great and white, growing deep in the ground, and spreading sundry long branches therein, in taste and smell stronger than the leaves or seeds, and continuing many years.</p><p><em>Place.</em> This grows in gardens.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Government and virtues.</em> These are all three of them of the nature of Jupiter, and under his dominion.
