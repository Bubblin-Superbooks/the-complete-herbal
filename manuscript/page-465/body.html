The stalks are branched into many long stems of spiked flowers half  a foot long, growing in bundles one above another, out of small husks, very like the spiked heads of Lavender, each of which flowers have five round-pointed leaves of a purple violet colour, or somewhat inclining to redness; in which husks stand small round heads after the flowers are fallen, wherein is contained small seed. The root creeps under ground like unto the yellow, but is greater than it, and so are the heads of the leaves when they first appear out of the ground, and more brown than the other.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Place.</em> It grows usually by rivers, and ditch-sides in wet ground, as about the ditches at and near Lambeth,</p></div> </div>
