To every pint of this decoction add one pound of sugar, and boil it over the fire till it come to a syrup, which you may know, if you now and then cool a little of it with a spoon: Scum it all the while it boils, and when it is sufficiently boiled, whilst it is hot, strain it again</p></div> </div>
