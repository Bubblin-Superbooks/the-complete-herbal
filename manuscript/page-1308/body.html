Pulps are also preserved, as Barberries, Cassia Fistula, Citrons, Cinosbatus, Quinces, and Sloes, &c. Take of Barberries as many as you will, boil them in spring water till they are tender, then having pulped them through a sieve, that they are free from the stones, boil it again in an earthen vessel over a gentle fire, often stirring them for fear of burning, till the watery humour be consumed, then mix ten pounds of sugar with six pounds of this pulp, boil it to its due thickness. Broom buds are also preserved, but with brine and vinegar, and so are Olives and Capers. Lastly, Amongst the Barks, Cinnamon, amongst the flowers, Roses, and Marigolds, amongst the fruits, Almonds, Cloves, Pine-nuts, and Fistick-nuts, are said to be preserved but with this difference, they are encrusted with dry sugar, and are more called confects than preserves. )</p><img class="overlay center" width = "0%" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,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" url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/the-complete-herbal/master/assets/images/lines.jpg" /></div> </div>
