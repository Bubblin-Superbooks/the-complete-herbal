It is of excellent use to mollify the hardness of swellings and discuss them, as also against inflammations; the smoke of it burnt is excellently good for the fits of the mother, and the falling-sickness: Inwardly taken in  wine it provokes the menses, helps the bitings of venomous beasts, and dissolves congealed blood in the body.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Ambergreese</em> is hot and dry in the second degree, I will not dispute whether it be a Gum or not: It strengthens nature much which way soever it be taken, there are but few grains usually given of it at a time: mixed with a little ointment of Orange flowers, and the temples and forehead anointed with it, it eases the pains</p></div> </div>
