At the joints with the leaves from the middle of the stalk upwards, where it spreads into branches, stand many small, pale, purplish flowers in hairy, rough heads, or husks, after which come small, black, rough seed, which will stick to any cloth or garment that shall touch it. The root is somewhat long, with small fibres thereat, of a dark reddish colour, which abides the Winter, although the stalks and leaves perish and spring every year.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Place.</em> It grows wild generally through the land, about the borders of fields, and by the sides of walls, and among rubbish. It will endure well being brought</p></div> </div>
