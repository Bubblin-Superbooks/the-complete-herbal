The Indian, also provokes urine, and stops fluxes, helps windiness of the stomach, resists the pestilence, helps gnawing pains of the stomach; and dries up rheums that molest the head. The Celtic Spikenard performs the same offices, though in a weaker measure.</p><p><em>Nenupharis, Nymphæ.</em> Of Water-lilies. They are cold and dry, and stop lust: I never dived so deep to find what virtue the roots have.</p><p><em>Ononidis, Arrestæ Bovis, &c.</em> Of Cammock, or Rest-harrow, so called because it makes oxen stand still when they are ploughing. The roots are hot and dry in the third degree; it breaks the stone (viz. the bark of it. The root itself, according to <em>Pliny</em>, helps the falling-sickness; according to <em>Matthiolus</em>, helps ruptures: you may take half a dram at a time. )</p></div> </div>
